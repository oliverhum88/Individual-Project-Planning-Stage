    "The dataset I will be using for my report is the players.csv dataset as I am going to be answering questions about how we can predict what kinds of players are most likely to contribute more data. In the original players.csv dataset, there are 196 rows and 7 columns, however after tidying the data there are 109 rows and 5 columns. The tidying that was performed on the dataset included removing any NA's from the The mean age is 21.3 years old with the minimum being 9 years old and the maximum being 58 years old. The mean hours played is 10.51 hours with the lowest amount of hours being 0.10 and the most amount of hours being 223.10 hours. In the origial dataset, there are 7 variables. 5 categorical variables which are experience, hashed email, name, gender, and if they are subscribed to the newsletter (subscribe). The other 2 variables are numerical which are played hours and age. The experience variable describes each persons perceived experience with the game, if they have a lot of hours they are likely going to consider themselves more of a \"Pro\". This creates an issue because perceived skill might not directly relate to how many hours they have played on the game. The subscribe variable is whether or not the player is subscribed to the game related newsletter. This can indicate how interested a person is in Minecraft and could relate to their played hours. The played hours is how many hours the player has spent playing Minecraft, a high amount of hours played will likely reflect a \"dedicated\" player. The gender variable is what gender each player identifies as. The age variable is how old the player is. \n",

    "# 4. Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "For my analysis, I plan to use a multiple linear regression to address my question of “can the characteristics of players such as experience, age and gender predict the total amount of time spent playing Minecraft in the players.csv dataset?”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is the most appropriate method to predict played hours due to the fact that the goal is to assess how multiple explanatory variables predict it. Linear regression is also known to be more reliable compared to KNN regression when it comes to larger data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the linear regression method, there are a few assumptions that are required. The relationship between each explanatory variable and the response variable must be close to linear. The predictor variables must also have a meaningful association with the response variable, meaning that they provide useful information in predicting a change in the response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the linear regression method is that the presence of outliers can influence the line of best fit. An outlier that deviates very far from the data can create a less accurate line of best fit. However, if the dataset is large enough, a few large outliers will not negatively impact the line of best fit very much. In a multiple linear regression, if the predictors are strongly linearly related, multicollinearity can occur. This can make it difficult for the model to differentiate between the individual effects of each of the predictor variables on the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select the best model, I will use RMSE to asses the performance of each model. Since RMSE measures prediction error, the model that produces the lowest RMSE value will indicate a higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to process the model, the data needs to be tidied so that all the variables are in a usable format. This includes removing irrelevant variables and removing any NA values. Categorical variables will also need to be converted into a factor. The dataset will be split into a training and testing set. The training set will be 80% and will help to tune the model. The testing set will be the remaining 20% and will be used to evaluate the predictive performance on data that is unseen. "
